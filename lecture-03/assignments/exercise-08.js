/* Exercise 8: The Safe Update
Scenario: You need to update a user's theme setting without mutating the original object.
Input:
JavaScript
const settings = { theme: "light", notifications: true };


Task:
Create a new variable newSettings.
Use the Spread Operator (...) to copy the properties from settings.
Overwrite the theme to "dark" inside the new object.
Verify settings.theme is still "light" (Immutable Check).
 */

const settings = { theme: "light", notifications: true};

const newSettings = {...settings, theme: "dark"};
console.log(settings.theme);
console.log(newSettings.theme);
